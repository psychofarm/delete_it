	# '__main__' is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. 
	
	# A moduleâ€™s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.
	
	# A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by checking its own __name__, 
	# which allows a common idiom for conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script 
	# or with python -m but not when it is imported:
	
	# For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a __main__.py module, 
	# the contents of which will be executed when the module is run with -m.
